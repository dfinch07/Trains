# Trains

Project Overview I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host train data including: first train time, frequency of train, train name and destination. A prospective user can submit this information on the application and it is saved to Firebase. The application retrieves and manipulates this information with the help of Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about the various trains including but not limited to: their destination, name, frequency, arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. The application does update the current time and the arrival time and minutes to arrival on its own with out refreshing the screen.
